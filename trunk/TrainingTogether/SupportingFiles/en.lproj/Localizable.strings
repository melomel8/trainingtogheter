It is very important that the basin rise up as much as possible and that the abdomen and lower back muscles will contract during boarding and alighting.

The bench has a different side than the plank, is in fact much more unstable. This instability is increased by the pendulum.

Attention: starting from the basic position of the bridge for buttocks we bridge for buttocks by removing completely the basin floor. This exercise has multiple stages. The first you need to be aware of the position of the body. Once with the pelvis in 4 supports execute the second phase which involves the loss of contact to the ground by one of the two legs. Now there are 3 racks. Maintaining stable this position we activate the stopwatch and throughout the year we will have to pull from the ground the opposite arm leading up to 1 second and back to Earth. In this way we will be lean 2 3 supports dynamically throughout the life of the time.

Bring up the arm and the opposite leg, using the other two as stabilizers. The strength of the abdomen and lower back muscles is essential for maintaining the balance.

Now you should be able to maintain stable leading position as high up as possible to both the leg and the opposite arm and back again to the starting position dynamically. 2 fixed points, then one name him zero position and another position 1 and you will have to go through both points for the duration of the exercise. Very important are the limbs that are in contact with the soil that will be used as stabilizers as well as abdominal and lumbar. Finished with the two chosen art perform the same with opposites.

Warning: this position presents a worthy instability of the last working session to which you came. You are definitely ready to deal with it thanks to the location, but be careful of some precautions. The exercise has two phases, stabilization and twist. First of all take conscience of the stabilization phase where the pelvis and spine must be aligned and stable. 2 disconnect position found opposite arts such as right leg and left arm. At this point start the second phase. The twist must be complete, pivoting on the foot and hand that are in contact with the ground. You always rotate the arm that is not in contact with the ground and the leg must push with much strength the body upward, making lose stability at the pelvis and back. The thrust phase you will be forced to return to the start position with a return phase where the control will be crucial and the return to stability of the pelvis. Run the exercise with 2 Arts for the total duration of time, run it with the other two.";

Keep positions for about 1 second. Attention: starting at the location of a 2 supports bench you will be able to perform this last position bench. It is important to maintain body stability and control during the two phases, that of expulsion and that contact between the elbow and knee opposite limbs. Always carry and dynamically opposing limbs into contact by impact for a second his elbow with the opposite knee, then return to the start position. Perform the exercise for the entire duration of the programme and then repeat with the opposite limbs.";
